# Ultrarmarathon Analysis

This project explores publicly available finisher data from my first ultramarathon, the Chicago Lakefront 50K race that took place on March 29, 2025. 

---

## Key Questions Explored

- How does **age** affect ultramarathon performance?
- How do **men and women** perform differently?
- How can measures like **variance**, **skewness**, and **distribution** reveal deeper insights?

---

## Summary of Findings

- **Age is not a limiting factor** : Some of the most consistent and fastest finishers were in their 40s and 50s.

- **Women perform competitively** : Despite making up only about a third of participants, women had a slightly higher completion rate and performed well across age groups.

- **Variability matters** : Looking beyond averages—examining the full spread of finish times—reveals the true dynamics of the field.
